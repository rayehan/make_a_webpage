<div class="about">
	<p>The acronym HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. This computer language is the first stepping stone to begin developing a webpage. So, without HTML there is no webpage irrespective of commercial or personal. HTML is also known as the beginning computer language as a way to step into development for the webpage development community. Unlike some core computer language, this is less intimidating the outcome of some code is almost instantaneous and very fulfilling. However, it has its limitation, and when I say limitation, I mean making things interactive in a very seamless manner.</p> 
	<p>
	Since it was the first appearance in 1980, HTML has come a long way. It has managed to challenge Adobe flush, which not long ago was the choice of tool to develop the multimedia delivery system for a commercial or for personal use.  HTML first seriously challenged the status quo of multimedia development community during first iPad appearance, where Steve Jobs mentioned that iPad would not support Adobe Flush for security reason and it’s tendency to consume a vast amount of processing power, and the choice for iPad was and still is HTML5.

	<p>
	In today’s market HTML5 with JS (javascript) and few other frameworks doing wonders on the web. Developers are creating captivating interactive websites. My son (6 yrs) completes his homework assignment online, and the whole page was designed using HTML5/CSS/JS.
	</p> 
	<p>
	In conclusion, I would like to say that just as Microsoft Windows gave the courage for many to buy and use the computer for personal use, HTML provides the same courage to many “want to be” developer such as myself. And I am trying develop this page as short reference for myself and in future I will post it for the folks who wants come to the development world.
